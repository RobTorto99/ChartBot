The first pane uses a 'circle' interpolation, while the second uses a 'polygon' interpolation. The chart includes a title and subtitle, styled with HTML tags for emphasis. The x-axis and y-axis are configured to display specific tick intervals and ranges, with the y-axis in the first pane having a tick interval of 2 and the second pane having a tick interval of 3. The chart includes two series: a column series in the first pane and an area series in the second pane. Custom colors are applied to the series, and additional configurations such as chart background color, margins, and legend alignment are included to enhance the visual presentation."
