The chart is titled 'Fruit Consumption' and includes data for various fruits, displayed in both pie and column formats. The pie chart allows for point selection and is centered on the right side of the chart area. The column chart uses color variations based on the data points and does not show in the legend. The chart is styled to adapt to both light and dark themes using CSS variables, which are applied based on user preference or selected theme. The styling includes custom colors for data series and points, as well as neutral and highlight color variations for better visual distinction. The chart also supports a tri-state theme selector, allowing users to choose between system default, light, and dark themes, dynamically changing the chart's appearance accordingly."
