The chart includes three data series: 'Scientific research and development', 'Hospital activities', and 'Fire service activities', each with low, median, and high values. Custom colors are applied to each series for better differentiation. The chart background is set to a light gray color, and the legend is positioned at the bottom of the chart. The tooltip is configured to be shared and sticky for better user interaction. Accessibility features are also included to ensure the chart is usable by screen readers."
