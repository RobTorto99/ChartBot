The chart type is specified as 'scatter', and the title is set to 'Scatter chart with jitter'. The x-axis categories are labeled as 'Run 1' through 'Run 5', and the y-axis is titled 'Measurements'. The chart uses semi-transparent colors for the data points to allow overlapping dots to be visible. The scatter plot options include jittering on the x-axis to spread out the points, a marker radius of 2, and a circle symbol for the markers. The tooltip displays the y-value of each point formatted to three decimal places. The series data is left empty in this configuration, as it would typically be populated dynamically with the `getTestData` function provided in the JavaScript code."
