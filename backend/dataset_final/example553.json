The chart background is set to light gray, and the legend is positioned at the bottom of the chart. The data series consists of two series: 'Sales' with blue data points [1, 2, 6, 1, 2, 4, 9] and 'Expenses' with red data points [0.5, 1.5, 3, 0.8, 1.2, 2, 4.5]. These configurations ensure a clear and visually appealing representation of the monthly sales and expenses data."
