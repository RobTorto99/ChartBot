There are three line series: 'Apples', 'Oranges', and 'Chilis', each with specified data points and color indices corresponding to green, orange, and red, respectively. Additionally, a pie series named 'Totals' is included, displaying the total values for 'Chilis' and 'Oranges' with the same color indices. The pie series is sized at 30% and positioned at the center of the chart at ['20%', '30%']. The chart is rendered in styled mode, allowing for custom CSS styling as defined in the provided CSS."
