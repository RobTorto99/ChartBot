The chart type is set to 'bar', and the title is 'Fruit Consumption by Person'. The X-axis is labeled with categories 'Apples', 'Oranges', 'Pears', 'Grapes', 'Bananas', and these labels are left-aligned. The Y-axis has a minimum value of 0 and is titled 'Total fruit consumption'. The legend is reversed, meaning the order of the series in the legend will be opposite to their order in the data series array. The chart includes three data series named 'John', 'Jane', and 'Joe', each with corresponding data values and custom colors. Additional configurations include setting the chart background to a light gray color (#f7f7f7) and adjusting the chart margins to provide more space around the chart area."
