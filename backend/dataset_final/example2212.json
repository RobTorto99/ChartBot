    "visualization_explanation": "The Venn diagram configuration uses three primary sets with distinct colors (#b3e5fc, #bee175, #ff3232) to represent unique character traits. Overlapping regions demonstrate conceptual intersections with blended opacity, while named overlaps (Spider Man, GOD, Spanish Inquisition, Santa) use white labels for contrast. Synthetic values (4 for individual sets, 1 for overlaps) create proportional areas while maintaining combinatorial logic (sum of all partitions = 15). The chart employs Tufte's data-ink principles through minimal borders and Cairo's perceptual effectiveness via color differentiation and label positioning. Responsive rules adapt label sizes to maintain readability on mobile devices, and the light gray background (#f2f2f2) ensures neutral visual context for the semantic overlaps."
