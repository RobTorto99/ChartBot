    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts configuration object is designed to render a pie chart that visualizes the market shares of different browsers in February 2022. The chart is titled 'Browser market shares in February, 2022' and is aligned to the left. The pie chart uses a monochrome color scheme, which is beneficial for accessibility and readability, especially for readers with color blindness. Each slice of the pie represents a different browser, with data provided for Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer, and Other browsers. The chart allows users to select individual slices, and each slice has a border radius for a more modern look. Data labels are enabled and formatted to display both the name of the browser and its percentage share, with a filter applied to only show labels for slices that represent more than 4% of the market."
