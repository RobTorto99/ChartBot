    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset contains three numerical dimensions (X/Y coordinates) and one ordinal dimension (fruit categories). Synthetic data was generated with four distinct clusters (\u03bc_x=2/4/6/8, \u03bc_y=3/5/5/7) using normal distributions (\u03c3=0.8) to simulate biological variability while maintaining categorical separation. The 3D scatter plot was chosen to preserve geometric relationships between variables, with depth cues addressing Cairo's principle of proportional ink. Despite 3D perception challenges, the rotational control and clustered coloring (colorByPoint) maintain Tufte's data-ink ratio by directly encoding categorical information in spatial position and hue. Statistical anchors show intentional overlap between adjacent categories (Bananas \u03bc_x=6 vs Kiwis \u03bc_x=8) to simulate real-world measurement overlap."
