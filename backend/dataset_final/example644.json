The data series is formatted to start from 1958 and includes the percentage values for each year. The chart also features a zooming capability, allowing users to zoom in on specific areas of the chart. Additionally, the legend is disabled, and the markers for the data points are turned off to provide a cleaner visual appearance. The tooltip for each data point displays the percentage value with a '%' suffix."
