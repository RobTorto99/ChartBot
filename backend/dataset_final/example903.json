The X-axis categories are defined to include specific labels, and the Y-axis has a tickPixelInterval of 30 with stackLabels enabled and cropping disabled. The data series include three sets of data points, each with intermediate sums and a final sum. The plotOptions specify normal stacking and a line width of 1 for the series. Additionally, the tooltip is configured to be shared across data points. This configuration effectively visualizes the data in a waterfall format, highlighting intermediate sums and the final sum."
