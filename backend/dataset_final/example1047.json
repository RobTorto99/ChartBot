    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset contains three numerical dimensions (X: continuous size index, Y: continuous sweetness score, Z: ordinal fruit type index) with 10 observations. Synthetic data was generated using \u03bc=5.0, \u03c3=2.8 for X-axis values and \u03bc=3.5, \u03c3=1.9 for Y-axis values, maintaining domain-appropriate ranges (0-10 scale). Z-axis categories were mapped to integers (0-3) with uniform distribution. The 3D scatter plot was selected to preserve geometric relationships in multivariate space while maintaining Tufte's data-ink ratio through minimal gridlines and uncluttered markers. Cairo's principles of salience were implemented through strategic color contrast (#e67e22 markers against blue Z-axis labels) and proportional encoding. Clustering patterns in synthetic data (density around X=1-2 and X=7-8 regions) demonstrate intentional variance creation while maintaining normal distribution characteristics in individual axes."
