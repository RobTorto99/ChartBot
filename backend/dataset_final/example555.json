The chart type is specified as 'bubble', and it includes a border around the plot area with a width of 1 pixel. The chart supports zooming in both the x and y directions. The title of the chart is 'Highcharts bubbles with color axis'. The x-axis has grid lines, while the y-axis does not start or end on ticks. The chart uses a color axis to differentiate the bubbles based on their 'x' values. The first series uses the 'x' value directly for color, while the second series uses a separate color axis with a gradient from '#434348' to '#e6ebf5'. This configuration effectively visualizes the data points with varying sizes and colors, providing a clear and interactive representation of the data."
