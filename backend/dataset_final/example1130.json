    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset represents a three-dimensional categorical space tracking supernatural attributes across cultural icons. Synthetic values follow equal distribution (4 base values, 1 intersections) to emphasize parity in mythological significance. Color coding maintains perceptual distance between moral judgment (blue), power responsibility (green), and visual identity (red). The Venn diagram maximizes data-ink ratio by using area encoding for set cardinality and strategic label placement. Cairo's principles of salience are implemented through chromatic contrast and intersection labeling, while the opacity stacking maintains legibility of overlapping regions. Responsive text scaling preserves Tufte's clarity principles across viewport sizes, with intersection labels using white text for maximum contrast against colored backgrounds."
