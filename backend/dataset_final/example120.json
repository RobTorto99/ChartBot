The chart type is set to 'solidgauge', and the title is 'Solidgauge data overflow past full circle (#2997)'. The pane configuration defines the start and end angles, as well as the background shape and radius. The yAxis is set to range from -5 to 5, with white labels styled to be easily readable on the dark background. The data series includes a single value of 38, and the color is set to a gradient from red to green, which is visually appealing and indicative of a range of values. This configuration ensures that the chart is both informative and visually consistent with the specified design requirements."
