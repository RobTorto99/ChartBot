The chart includes two data series: 'Data Grouping disabled' and 'Data Grouping enabled', each with their respective data points. The x-axis represents 'Sample size' with categories ranging from 10 to 100,000, and the labels are formatted to display values in thousands. The y-axis represents 'Time (s)' with labels formatted to display values in seconds and a minimum value of 0. The chart uses custom colors for the series and includes zooming capabilities for both x and y axes. Accessibility features are also enabled, providing descriptions for each data point. The tooltip is shared and formatted to display the loading time for each category of points."
