The chart features two data series: 'Sales 2022' and 'Sales 2023', each with corresponding monthly sales data. The chart's background is set to white, and the margins are adjusted to 50 pixels on all sides for better spacing. The axes and labels are styled with a dark gray color and a font size of 12px, ensuring readability. The legend is positioned at the bottom of the chart, centered horizontally, and styled to match the axes and labels. Custom colors are applied to the series, with 'Sales 2022' in green and 'Sales 2023' in orange, enhancing visual distinction between the two datasets."
