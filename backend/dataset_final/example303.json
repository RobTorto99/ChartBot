    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts configuration is designed to render a pie chart that visualizes the distribution of registered private vehicles in Norway by type of fuel for the year 2020. The chart includes a title aligned to the left and a tooltip that displays the percentage of each category when hovered over. The pie slices are selectable, and data labels are enabled with a specific format that includes the name of the category and its percentage, styled with a larger font size for the name and a slightly transparent percentage value. The chart also includes accessibility features, ensuring that the percentage values are appended with '%' for better readability. The gradient fill for the pie slices adds a decorative effect, enhancing the visual appeal of the chart."
