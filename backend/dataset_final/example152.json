    "visualization_prompt": "Create a Highcharts chartOptions object to render a gauge chart with the title 'Speedometer'. The chart should have a speedometer-like appearance with a start angle of -150 degrees and an end angle of 150 degrees. The background should have two panes with different radii. The y-axis should represent speed in km/h, ranging from 0 to 200, with minor ticks and labels styled appropriately. The plot bands should indicate different speed ranges with custom colors: green for 'good' (0-120 km/h), yellow for 'bad' (120-160 km/h), and red for 'ugly' (160-200 km/h). The series should display the current speed with a tooltip showing the value in km/h. Additionally, the chart should update the speed value every 3 seconds with a random increment or decrement.",

    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object configures a gauge chart with a speedometer-like appearance. The chart type is set to 'gauge', and the title is 'Speedometer'. The pane configuration defines the start and end angles for the gauge, creating a semi-circular shape. The background includes two panes with different outer radii, creating a layered effect. The y-axis represents the speed in km/h, ranging from 0 to 200. It includes minor ticks and labels styled with specific colors and positions. The plot bands are used to visually differentiate speed ranges: green for 'good' (0-120 km/h), yellow for 'bad' (120-160 km/h), and red for 'ugly' (160-200 km/h). The series displays the current speed with a tooltip showing the value in km/h. The chart is set to update the speed value every 3 seconds with a random increment or decrement, simulating a dynamic speedometer."
