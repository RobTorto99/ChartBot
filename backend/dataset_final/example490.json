The axes and labels are styled with a dark color (#333) and appropriate font sizes for readability. The chart title is aligned to the left with a margin of 25 pixels and styled with a specific color and font size. Custom colors are assigned to the series to differentiate them visually. The legend is disabled, and the tooltip is configured to share data across series. Additionally, the sonification module is enabled with a duration of 3000 milliseconds and simultaneous order, allowing for auditory feedback when interacting with the chart."
