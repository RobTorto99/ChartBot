The chart type is set to 'spline', and the background color is set to white for a clean appearance. The title of the chart is dynamically set to the indicator name fetched from the JSON data. The tooltip displays the series name and the value with two decimal places, formatted with a colored circle for better readability. The plot options disable markers on the data points for a smoother visual effect. The subtitle indicates the data source as 'World Bank Data'. The x-axis categories are set to the reversed year list to ensure the earliest year appears on the left. The y-axis title is set to 'Values'. The legend is positioned at the bottom of the chart, centered horizontally. The series name is dynamically set to the country name, and the data is reversed to match the x-axis categories."
