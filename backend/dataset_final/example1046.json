    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset contains 100 synthetic 3D points with coordinates (X,Y,Z) all ranging 0-10, representing a simulated multivariate distribution. While artificial, the data maintains domain consistency through constrained value ranges and exhibits random dispersion without systematic bias (\u03bc\u22484.5-5.5 across axes, \u03c3\u22482.8-3.2). The 3D scatter plot was selected to preserve geometric relationships in multivariate space while enabling depth perception through interactive rotation. Following Tufte's principles, the minimal axis framing and transparent chart walls maximize data-ink ratio. Cairo's depth cues are implemented through perspective projection and dynamic shading during rotation. Color gradients (radial intensity variation with Z-values) provide redundant encoding of vertical position, satisfying perceptual discriminability requirements for 3D visualization."
