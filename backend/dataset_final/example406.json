The chart includes a title 'Marker clusters demo' and axes ranging from 0 to 100. The data series is a scatter plot with red markers. The chart allows for zooming in both the x and y directions and includes grid lines on the x-axis. The cluster settings include enabling clusters, setting a minimum cluster size of 3, disallowing overlap, and using a grid layout algorithm with a grid size of 50. Data labels are enabled for the series, and cluster data labels are styled with a font size of 8px. The clusters are divided into zones based on their size, with each zone having a different marker color and radius to visually distinguish them."
