The bars are stacked by percentage to easily compare the gender distribution within each profession. Additional configurations include accessibility settings for better usability, a tooltip that displays the percentage of each gender in a profession, and styling for the tooltip background and border. The chart is designed to be informative and accessible, providing a clear visual representation of the data."
