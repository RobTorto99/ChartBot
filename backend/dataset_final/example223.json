The chart has a title 'Pattern Fill Example' and a subtitle 'With Pattern Transform', both styled with specific colors and font sizes. The pie chart contains one series with a single data point, which is filled with a custom pattern defined by a path, width, height, color, and pattern transform. The axes and labels are styled with specific colors and font sizes for better readability. The chart background is set to white, and the legend is positioned at the bottom right of the chart. This configuration ensures a visually appealing and informative pie chart with a unique pattern fill effect."
