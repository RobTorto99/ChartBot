The x-axis is configured as a category axis, suitable for displaying the names of the ideas, while the y-axis is titled 'Votes' and aligned to the high position. Data labels are enabled on the bars to show the vote counts directly on the chart. The legend and credits are disabled to keep the chart clean and focused on the data.
