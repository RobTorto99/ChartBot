    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object is configured to render a scatter plot with 1 million data points. The chart is optimized for performance using the Highcharts Boost module, which enables GPU translations and pre-allocated memory for faster rendering. The x-axis and y-axis are both set to range from 0 to 100, with grid lines for better readability. The title of the chart is 'Scatter chart with 1 million points', aligned to the left. The legend is disabled, and the data points are colored with a light red shade (rgba(152,0,67,0.1)). The chart also includes accessibility features, such as screen reader support, and allows for zooming in both the x and y directions. The data series is left empty in this configuration, as the actual data points are generated dynamically in the JavaScript code."
