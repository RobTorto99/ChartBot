The title of the chart is 'The 5 highest pyramids in the World', and custom colors are applied to each pyramid for better visual distinction. The x-axis is a category axis with labels styled to have a font size of 14px, and the y-axis has a minimum value of 0 with a title 'Height (m)'. The tooltip displays the height in meters when hovering over a pyramid. The data series includes the name of each pyramid and its corresponding height, with the 'colorByPoint' option set to true to apply the custom colors to each data point. The legend is hidden by setting 'showInLegend' to false."
