    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object configures a column chart with specific settings for the title, axes, data series, and responsiveness. The chart type is set to 'column', and the title is 'Born persons, by girls' name'. The x-axis categories are the years 2021, 2022, and 2023, with labels slightly offset to the left. The y-axis does not allow decimals and is titled 'Amount'. The chart includes three data series: 'Ava' with data [34, 39, 53], 'Dina' with data [27, 21, 22], and 'Malin' with data [41, 34, 32]. The legend is aligned to the right, vertically centered, and laid out vertically. The chart is responsive, with a rule that changes the legend alignment to center, bottom, and horizontal, and removes the y-axis title and subtitle when the screen width is 500px or less. This ensures the chart remains readable on smaller screens."
