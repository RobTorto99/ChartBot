The chart should have a title 'Earth's atmosphere' and a subtitle with a link to a NASA source. The x-axis should be hidden, and the y-axis should also be hidden but should have a minimum value of 0. The chart should use a stacking mode of 'percent' for the columns, with a black border and white color for the columns. Each column should have data labels enabled, displaying the series name and a custom height attribute. The tooltip should display custom information about each layer. The legend should be disabled. The chart should include six series representing different layers of the atmosphere: Exosphere, Ionosphere, Thermosphere, Mesosphere, Stratosphere, and Troposphere, each with custom height and info attributes.",
