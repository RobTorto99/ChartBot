The y-axis is set to range from 0 to 12, with a red plot line at y=10 to visually indicate the alert threshold. The chart includes a single series named 'Random data' with initial data [1.1]. Accessibility features are enabled to announce new data points, with a custom formatter that only announces points above 10. The chart is designed to be interactive, with a button to start and stop live data updates, simulating real-time data input."
