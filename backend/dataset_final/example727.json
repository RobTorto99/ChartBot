    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object is configured to render a packed bubble chart. The chart type is set to 'packedbubble' with a height of 80% of the container. The title of the chart is 'Coffee Consumption' and the subtitle is 'Simple packed bubble'. The tooltip is formatted to display the name and value of each data point using HTML. The plot options for the packed bubble include enabling data labels with a specific format and style, and setting a minimum point size. The data series include three categories: 'Coffee', 'Energy drinks', and 'Tea', each with its own set of data points. Custom colors are applied to specific data points, such as 'Mustapha' in the 'Tea' series, which is colored pink. This configuration ensures a visually appealing and informative packed bubble chart."
