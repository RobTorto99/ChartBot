    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset contains categorical nominal data showing political party seat allocations across 13 Canadian regions. Each data point represents seat counts per party-province combination, sourced from verified election results. Synthetic data was not required as complete historical records exist. Pie charts were selected to emphasize proportional relationships within each jurisdiction while maintaining cross-region comparability through consistent encoding. Color associations follow party branding standards for immediate recognition. The minimal design (removed legend, hidden labels) adheres to Tufte's data-ink ratio principles by eliminating redundant elements. Cairo's perceptual principles are applied through area-proportional sectors and categorical color distinction. The Ontario example shows \u03bc=24.2 seats per party (\u03c3=32.1), reflecting the Liberal Party's dominance in that province."
