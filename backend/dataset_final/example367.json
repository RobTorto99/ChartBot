    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object configures a column chart that visualizes the top 10 countries by their nuclear and renewable energy production in 2011. The chart is titled 'Top 10 nuclear vs renewable energy producers (2011)' and includes a subtitle linking to the data source on Wikipedia. The X-axis displays the names of the top 10 countries, while the Y-axis labels are formatted to show percentages. The chart includes three data series: 'Hydropower', 'Other renewable', and 'Nuclear', each with specific data points for each country. The columns are stacked in percentage format, allowing for easy comparison of the contribution of each energy type to the total. The tooltip is shared and formatted to display the series color, name, and percentage, providing additional context when hovering over the columns. The custom colors for the series are set to '#949494', '#606060', and '#2a2a2a', ensuring a consistent and visually appealing color scheme."
