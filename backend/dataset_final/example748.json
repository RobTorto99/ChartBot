    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object is configured to render a spline chart. The chart's title and subtitle are dynamically set based on the selected indicator and country. The x-axis categories are populated with the years from the data, and the series data is populated with the corresponding indicator values. The tooltip is formatted to display the indicator value with two decimal places, enhancing readability. This setup ensures that the chart dynamically adapts to the selected data, providing a clear and informative visualization of the indicator's trend over time for the chosen country."
