The chart includes a main title and a subtitle, both aligned to the left, providing context and a source reference. The pie chart is rendered in 3D with an alpha angle of 45 degrees and a beta angle of 0 degrees, giving it a three-dimensional appearance. The tooltip displays the series name and the percentage value of each slice, formatted to one decimal place. The pie chart allows for point selection, with a cursor pointer indicating interactivity. Data labels are enabled, showing the name of each slice. The data series is named 'Share' and includes slices for Samsung, Apple, Xiaomi (with a selected and sliced appearance), Oppo*, Vivo, and Others, each representing their respective market share percentages."
