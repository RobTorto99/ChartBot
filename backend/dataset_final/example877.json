The title font size should be 18px and the axis labels font size should be 12px. Data series: The data for the City Consumption series should be derived from the 'dataSource' array and the data for the Highway Consumption series should be derived from the 'dataSourceHighway' array. Both series should use a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) to smooth the data. Custom colors: Use the specified colors for the series. Additional configurations: Set the chart margins to 50px on all sides, add a subtitle with a link to the data source, and disable the markers for the series.",

The chart title is styled with a font size of 18px and the axis labels are styled with a font size of 12px. The 'City Consumption' series is colored in dark blue (#1E90FF) and the 'Highway Consumption' series is colored in orange (#ff8d1e). The data for both series is derived from the 'dataSource' and 'dataSourceHighway' arrays, respectively, and is smoothed using a Gaussian Kernel Density Estimation (KDE). The chart includes a subtitle with a link to the data source and has markers disabled for the series. The chart margins are set to 50px on all sides to provide adequate spacing around the chart."
