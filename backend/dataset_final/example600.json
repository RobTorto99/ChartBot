    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object is configured to render a column chart that visualizes the top 10 countries by their percentage contributions to nuclear and renewable energy production in 2011. The chart is titled 'Top 10 nuclear vs renewable energy producers (2011)' and includes a subtitle linking to the source data on Wikipedia. The X-axis represents the countries, while the Y-axis displays the percentage values. The chart uses three data series: 'Hydropower', 'Other renewable', and 'Nuclear', each with specific percentage data for each country. The columns are stacked in percentage format, allowing for easy comparison of the contributions of each energy type within each country. The tooltip displays the series name and the percentage value, formatted to show the contribution of each series in a shared tooltip. Custom colors are applied to the series for better visual distinction."
