The chart type is set to 'line', and it includes a title 'Monthly Average Temperature' and a subtitle with a link to the source data on Wikipedia. The x-axis is labeled with month names, and the y-axis is labeled 'Temperature (\u00b0C)'. The chart displays two data series: 'Reggane' and 'Tallinn', each showing the average temperature for each month. Data labels are enabled for each data point to enhance readability, and mouse tracking is disabled. This configuration ensures that the chart is informative and easy to interpret, providing clear visual representation of the temperature data over the months."
