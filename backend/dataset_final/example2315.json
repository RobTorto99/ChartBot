    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset represents a univariate time series with 12 monthly observations. Categorical x-axis labels (months) coordinate with continuous quantitative y-values (millimeters). Synthetic data was generated with \u03bc=125.4mm and \u03c3=56.2mm, showing summer peak rainfall (June-Sept) and winter minimums (Dec-Feb) reflecting typical mid-latitude patterns. The spline chart was chosen to emphasize seasonal trends through curve smoothing while maintaining Tufte's data-ink ratio by eliminating gridlines. Cairo's perceptual principles are applied through position encoding (months on ordinal axis) and length encoding (rainfall magnitude). Color choices ensure accessibility with sufficient contrast between blue labels and light background. Statistical anchors include the 209.7mm September peak (+67% above mean) and December minimum at 35.2mm (-72% from mean)."
