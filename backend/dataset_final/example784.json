The map includes a basemap of Norway and a series of markers representing accident locations. The visualization allows users to filter accidents by speed limit using a timeline control. The number of accidents for the selected speed limit is displayed dynamically. The map navigation is enabled for user interaction, and tooltips provide additional information about each accident when hovered over."
