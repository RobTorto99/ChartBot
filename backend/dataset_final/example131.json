    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object configures a spline chart with a title 'Solar Employment Growth by Sector, 2010-2016' and a subtitle indicating the data source. The y-axis is labeled 'Number of Employees'. The legend is styled to be vertically aligned in the middle and right-aligned. The plot options include disabling series label connectors and setting the data point start year to 2010. The data series include five categories: 'Installation', 'Manufacturing', 'Sales & Distribution', 'Project Development', and 'Other', each with corresponding data points. The chart is made responsive with a rule that changes the legend layout to horizontal, center-aligned, and bottom-aligned when the chart width is 500px or less. This configuration ensures a clean and informative visualization that adapts to different screen sizes."
