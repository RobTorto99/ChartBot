The x-axis should have tick marks placed on the labels, and the y-axis should have a grid line width of 1. Data series: The series should represent the monthly average temperature for a year, with data points for each month. Custom colors: Use a gradient from light blue (#ADD8E6) to dark blue (#1F4E79) for the series. Additional configurations: Set the chart background to a light gray color (#F5F5F5), add a legend at the bottom of the chart, and set the chart margins to 50 pixels on all sides.",

    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object is configured to render a spline chart displaying the monthly average temperature for a year. The chart is titled 'Monthly Average Temperature' and uses a spline chart type to smoothly connect the data points. The x-axis represents the months of the year with labels styled in dark blue (#1F4E79) and a font size of 14px. The y-axis displays the temperature values, also styled with the same color and font size, and includes grid lines for better readability. The data series contains the temperature data for each month, with a custom color gradient from light blue (#ADD8E6) to dark blue (#1F4E79) to visually represent the temperature changes. The chart background is set to a light gray (#F5F5F5), and the legend is positioned at the bottom center of the chart. The chart margins are set to 50 pixels on all sides to ensure the chart elements are not too close to the edges."
