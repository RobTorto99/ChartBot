    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object is configured to render a column chart with specific styling and data series. The chart type is set to 'column', and the title is 'Styling axes'. The yAxis configuration includes two axes, each with a different class name ('highcharts-color-0' and 'highcharts-color-1') to apply custom colors defined in the CSS. The primary axis is on the left side, and the secondary axis is on the right side (opposite). The plotOptions for the column series include a border radius of 5 pixels for rounded corners. The data series include two sets of data, one for each axis, with the second series mapped to the secondary yAxis. The chart is rendered in styled mode, allowing the use of CSS for styling, which is linked to the series colors and axis colors as defined in the CSS."
