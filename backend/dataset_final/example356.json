    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts configuration is designed to render a column chart that visualizes the layers of Earth's atmosphere. The chart type is set to 'column', and it includes a title and subtitle with a link to a NASA source. The x-axis and y-axis are both hidden, with the y-axis having a minimum value of 0. The chart uses a stacking mode of 'percent' for the columns, which allows the layers to be stacked on top of each other in a percentage format. Data labels are enabled and formatted to display the series name and height, with black text and no text outline. The tooltip is customized to display additional information about each layer when hovered over. The legend is disabled, and custom colors are applied to the series, as specified in the Highcharts.setOptions call. This configuration effectively visualizes the layers of the atmosphere in a clear and informative manner."
