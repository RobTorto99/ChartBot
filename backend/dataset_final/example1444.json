    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset contains three-dimensional numerical data points across two series, representing spatial relationships with size encoding. Synthetic data maintains domain consistency through constrained value ranges (X/Y: 0-100, size: 1-100) and demonstrates cluster patterns through spatial grouping. The bubble chart maximizes data-ink ratio by encoding three variables in position/size while maintaining Cairo's preattentive processing through color separation. Dual color axes (\u03bc=45\u00b125 for primary, \u03bc=50\u00b135 for secondary) enable simultaneous analysis of two additional dimensions without visual overload. Chart interactions (zooming) preserve density relationships while gridlines maintain positional accuracy."
