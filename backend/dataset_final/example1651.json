    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset represents a two-level hierarchical structure of financial assets with nominal flow quantities. As a directed acyclic graph (DAG), it contains 9 edges connecting 10 unique nodes, with weights expressed in millions USD. Primary dimensions include asset categories (categorical nominal) and monetary values (ratio scale). Source data from verified financial disclosures ensures accuracy, with all flows maintaining strict additive consistency (Current + Non-Current = 323.88M USD total assets). The Sankey diagram maximizes data-ink ratio by eliminating chart junk while maintaining clear flow magnitude encoding through link widths. Cairo's principles of salience are applied through strategic color blocking (gray scale for neutral financial context) and immediate legibility of major cash flows. Proportional weights maintain Weber-Fechner law compliance for accurate magnitude perception, with the dominant Cash\u2192Current Assets relationship (63.3% of current assets) visually emphasized through maximum link width."
