    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object is configured to render a spline chart titled 'Fruits Consumption'. The chart includes two data series: 'Apples' and 'Oranges', each with their respective data points. The chart's background is set to light gray, and the margins are adjusted to 50 pixels on all sides for better spacing. The text styling for titles and labels is set to a dark gray color with specific font sizes for readability. The legend is positioned at the bottom of the chart for easy access. Additionally, custom gradient colors are applied to each series to visually differentiate them, with 'Apples' using a gradient from green to red and 'Oranges' using a gradient from orange to yellow."
