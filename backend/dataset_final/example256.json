The X-axis is set to display datetime values, while the Y-axis title is left empty. The tooltip is styled with crosshairs, shared mode, a value suffix of '\u00b0C', and a date format that displays the day of the week and the month and day. The data series is named 'Temperatures' and is expected to be populated with data fetched from a specified URL. The series color is a gradient that transitions from red to blue, and the legend symbol color is set to a custom purple. Additional configurations include enabling X-axis zooming and setting up a scrollable plot area with a minimum width of 600 pixels and a scroll position of 1."
