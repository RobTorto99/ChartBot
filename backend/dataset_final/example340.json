The chart type is set to 'column', and the title is 'Average weight and BMI in some countries, women'. The x-axis categories represent different countries, while the y-axis is divided into two sections: one for 'Weight' and another for 'BMI'. The 'Weight' series is associated with the primary y-axis, and the 'BMI' series is associated with the secondary y-axis. The chart includes custom styling for the axes and series colors, as defined in the CSS. The plotOptions for the column series include a border radius of 5 to give the columns rounded edges. The tooltip for the 'Weight' series displays the value with 'kg' as a suffix, enhancing user readability."
