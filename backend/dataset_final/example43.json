The chart is inverted to display horizontally, with a height of 100 pixels. The title of the chart is set to 'A Horizontal Linear Gauge'. The x-axis is styled with a light gray line color and has its labels disabled, while the y-axis is configured with a range from 0 to 100, with labels formatted to display percentages. The y-axis also includes plot bands to visually represent different ranges with specific colors. The legend is disabled, and the series contains a single data point set to 92, with custom black color and data labels enabled to display the value as a percentage. Additional configurations include the chart's background and margins, which are not explicitly set in this configuration but can be adjusted as needed."
