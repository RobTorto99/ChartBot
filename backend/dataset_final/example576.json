    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts configuration object is designed to render a gauge chart with specific visual and functional attributes. The chart type is set to 'gauge', which is suitable for displaying a single value within a defined range. The title of the chart is 'Gauge with plot band labels', which is displayed prominently at the top. The pane configuration defines the angular range of the gauge and its background styling, including a light gray background with specific radius settings. The yAxis configuration sets the range from 0 to 120, with minor tick intervals and plot bands that color-code different speed ranges (green, yellow, red) and label them accordingly. The series data includes a single value of 80, representing the current speed, with a tooltip displaying the value in 'km/h'. This configuration effectively visualizes a speedometer-like gauge with clear, color-coded indicators for different speed thresholds."
