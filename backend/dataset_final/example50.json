The chart should have a title 'Dynamic chart with static scale', with the x-axis labeled 'Depth (m)' and styled with a specific font size and color.

    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object is configured to render a spline chart with dynamic data updates. The chart has a light green background and is inverted, giving it a unique visual perspective. The title of the chart is 'Dynamic chart with static scale', styled with a font size of 18px and a dark gray color. The x-axis is labeled 'Depth (m)' and styled with a specific font size and color, while the y-axis is labeled 'Value' with similar styling. The data series is named 'Readings' and is initially empty, but it will be updated dynamically every second with random data points. The chart includes a static scale on the x-axis and will shift old points out once the number of data points exceeds 20. The legend is disabled, and the series animation duration is set to 500 milliseconds for smoother transitions."
