The chart should have a title 'Gauge with log axis', and the gauge should display a speed value with a suffix ' km/h'.

The axes and labels should be styled with specific colors and font sizes. Additionally, the chart should have a custom button for rotating the gauge.",

The y-axis labels and ticks are styled with specific colors and sizes, ensuring clarity and readability. The series data includes a single value of 80 km/h, and the tooltip displays this value with a suffix ' km/h'. The chart is designed to be interactive, with a custom button for rotating the gauge, enhancing user experience."
