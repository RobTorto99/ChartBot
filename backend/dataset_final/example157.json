The chart title is set to 'USD to EUR Exchange Rate', and the axes and labels are styled with a dark color (#333) and specific font sizes (12px for labels, 14px for titles). The data series includes the name 'USD to EUR' and uses the 'ohlcdata' provided. Custom colors are applied to the candlesticks: green (#35bd00) for up trends and orange (#ff5e00) for down trends. The chart is set to use styled mode, which allows for CSS styling, and the range selector is configured to display the first option by default. This configuration ensures a clear and visually appealing representation of the exchange rate data."
