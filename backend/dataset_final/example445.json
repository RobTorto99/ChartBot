    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object configures a pie chart to display the composition of air. The chart is titled 'Air composition' and includes three data series representing Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Other gases, each with their respective percentages. The chart uses specific colors for each data point, allowing for easy differentiation. The pie chart is configured to allow point selection, with a cursor pointer indicating interactivity. Data labels are enabled and formatted to show both the name of the gas and its percentage. The chart also includes a legend for better readability. Additionally, the pie chart has an inner size of 75%, giving it a donut-like appearance, which can help in emphasizing the distribution of the data."
