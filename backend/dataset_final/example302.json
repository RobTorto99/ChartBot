This chart type is suitable for visualizing a second dimension in a pie chart, where the radius of each slice can vary based on a secondary data point. In this case, the chart compares countries by their population density and total area. The chart includes a title aligned to the left, and a tooltip that displays detailed information about each country, including its name, total area, and population density. The data series contains seven countries, each with its respective data points. Custom colors are applied to each slice of the pie chart to enhance visual distinction between the countries. The chart is designed to be visually appealing and informative, providing a clear comparison of the countries based on the given metrics."
