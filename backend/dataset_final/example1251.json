    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset contains hierarchical financial data with 9 nodes and 8 links, representing a two-level decomposition of $323.88B total assets. Categorical variables (asset categories) are connected through continuous weight values (USD billions). Source data from Yahoo Finance demonstrates complete hierarchy closure (Current + Non-Current Assets = Total Assets). The Sankey diagram maximizes data-ink ratio by using proportional flow widths to encode values, eliminating need for separate axis labels. Cairo's principle of perceptual transparency is achieved through: 1) Monochromatic encoding with border contrast for figure-ground separation 2) Weight-sorted vertical node arrangement 3) Direct value labeling within flows. Financial breakdown shows strong left-skewed distribution (Cash = 63.3% of Current Assets, Investments = 56.0% of Non-Current Assets), with synthetic validation through mass balance verification (\u2211 inputs = \u2211 outputs for all nodes)."
