The chart is of type 'organization', which is suitable for displaying structured data in a tree-like format. The title of the chart is set to 'Highcharts Centered Org Chart', and the chart is inverted to better suit the organization layout. The data series includes relationships between various roles (CTO, CPO, CEO, CSO, CMO, HR), with specific nodes styled differently, such as the CEO node being colored '#980104' and having a border radius of 50%. The data labels are styled in white for better contrast against the background. Additionally, the chart includes exporting options that allow HTML content and specifies the source dimensions for exporting."
