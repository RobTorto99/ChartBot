The chart is titled 'MSIS atmospheric composition by height' and includes a subtitle with a link to the source data on Wikipedia. The x-axis represents the height in kilometers, and the y-axis represents the volume fraction of gases in percentage. Each series in the chart corresponds to a different gas, with custom colors assigned to each series for better differentiation. The chart includes a tooltip that displays the series name and value in percentage when hovering over data points. The plot options for the areaspline chart include stacking the data in percentage mode, disabling markers, and styling the labels with a specific font size and opacity. The overall design is clean and informative, making it easy to interpret the data."
