    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset contains a single-dimensional numerical series with 30 sequential integer values (0-29). Synthetic data follows a perfect linear progression (slope=1) with zero variance, specifically designed to demonstrate axis break functionality. Data quality is maximized through controlled generation without noise. The line chart was selected to preserve data continuity while using axis breaks to visually segment the progression space. Broken intervals (5-10 repeating every 10 units) apply Tufte's data-ink ratio principle by removing non-data gridlines in break zones. Color choices (#2caffe line vs #666 labels) follow Cairo's preattentive processing principles for immediate break recognition. Statistical anchors confirm the synthetic data's perfect linearity (r\u00b2=1.0) and discontinuity pattern (20% of x-axis range omitted in repeating breaks)."
