    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object is configured to render a solid gauge chart that represents an engine RPM gauge. The chart type is set to 'solidgauge', and the title is styled with a dark gray color and a font size of 14px. The gauge itself is configured with a start angle of -90 degrees and an end angle of 90 degrees, creating a semi-circular shape. The y-axis is set to range from -5 to 5, with labels styled in dark gray and a font size of 12px. The data series includes a single data point of -1, representing the engine RPM, and the gauge uses a gradient from red to green to visually indicate the RPM value. Additional configurations include setting the chart margins to 20 pixels on all sides, adding a legend with a white background and black text, and ensuring the chart background is light gray. This setup provides a clear and visually appealing representation of the engine RPM."
