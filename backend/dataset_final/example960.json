The x-axis should have categories 'Jan', 'Feb', 'Mar', 'Apr', 'May', 'Jun', 'Jul', 'Aug', 'Sep', 'Oct', 'Nov', 'Dec'. The y-axis should have labels styled with a font size of 12px and color #333333. The chart should have three data series named 'Product A', 'Product B', and 'Product C' with the following data: [10, 15, 13, 17, 20, 22, 25, 27, 30, 32, 35, 40] for 'Product A', [5, 8, 10, 12, 15, 18, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 35] for 'Product B', and [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24] for 'Product C'. Use custom colors #4CAF50, #2196F3, and #FF9800 respectively. The chart should have a white background, a legend positioned at the bottom, and a margin of 50 pixels on all sides.",

The x-axis is labeled with months from January to December, while the y-axis labels are styled with a font size of 12px and a color of #333333. The chart includes three data series: 'Product A', 'Product B', and 'Product C', each with its own set of data points and a unique color. The chart has a white background and a margin of 50 pixels on all sides. The legend is positioned at the bottom of the chart, horizontally aligned and centered. This configuration effectively visualizes the monthly sales performance of three different products, allowing for easy comparison between them."
