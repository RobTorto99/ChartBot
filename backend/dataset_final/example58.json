The y-axis is hidden and ranges from 0 to 1. The chart includes multiple series, each with specific data points and line widths. The first series connects points (0,1) and (4,1), the second series connects points (0,1) and (1,1) with a line width of 5, and so on. The chart is configured to use polar settings, with additional configurations for chart margins, background, and legend settings as needed."
