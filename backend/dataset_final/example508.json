The chart includes two data series: one for average temperatures and another for temperature ranges. The x-axis is configured as a datetime axis with the title 'Day', while the y-axis is titled 'Temperature' and formatted to display values in degrees Celsius. The tooltip is shared and appends '\u00b0C' to the values. The legend is disabled, and the chart background is set to a light gray color. The temperature range series is rendered as an area range with a semi-transparent fill color, providing a visual representation of the temperature variability over time."
