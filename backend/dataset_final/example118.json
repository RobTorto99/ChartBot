The chart type is set to 'boxplot', and the title is 'Configuring whisker lengths'. The y-axis does not have a title, and the legend is disabled. The data series includes three data points, each with different whisker lengths specified. The first data point has a whisker length of 50%, the second has a lower whisker length of 150%, and the third has an upper whisker length of 10%. These configurations ensure that the boxplot chart visually represents the specified whisker lengths for each data point."
