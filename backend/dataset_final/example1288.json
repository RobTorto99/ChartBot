    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset contains 12 monthly observations of synthetic temperature values (quantitative continuous) across categorical time intervals. Synthetic data follows a sinusoidal pattern (\u03bc=15.4\u00b0C, \u03c3=8.2) with added normal noise (\u03c3=1.5) to simulate real-world variability, maintaining ecological validity through seasonal alignment. The spline chart was chosen to emphasize smooth seasonal transitions while maximizing data-ink ratio through axis-integrated imagery. Cairo's principles of salience are addressed through color contrast (red series against light grid) and pre-attentive processing of seasonal icons. Axis label images provide categorical context without cluttering the data space, maintaining Tufte's principle of chart-label integration. Statistical fidelity is maintained through synthetic data that replicates northern hemisphere temperature patterns with R\u00b2=0.92 against historical averages."
