The chart type is set to 'column', and it is inverted and polar, which means the chart will be displayed in a circular format with columns radiating from the center. The title of the chart is 'Crosshair enabled on both axes', and there is a subtitle indicating that the crosshair snap option is set to false. The xAxis and yAxis configurations include a tick interval and a red crosshair with a width of 2 and a zIndex of 5, ensuring it appears above other chart elements. The data series contains a single series with the provided data points. Additional configurations include a marginTop of 40 to adjust the spacing above the chart."
