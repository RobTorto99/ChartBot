The x-axis is categorical, representing different European countries, while the y-axis represents labor costs. Each column's width is proportional to the country's GDP, as indicated by the custom caption. Data labels are enabled and formatted to display labor costs in euros, and tooltips provide additional information, including GDP in millions of euros. The legend is disabled, and the chart uses a color scheme where each data point is colored differently, enhancing visual distinction between countries."
