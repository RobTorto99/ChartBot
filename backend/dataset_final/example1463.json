    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset contains 9 categorical professions with two percentage variables (Men/Women), forming a 9x2 matrix. Data originates from authoritative Swedish National Statistics, ensuring real-world validity rather than synthetic generation. Each category's percentages sum to 100%, maintaining proportional integrity through manual curation rather than algorithmic generation.\n\nThe stacked bar chart maximizes data-ink ratio by using position and color contrast to encode gender proportions, adhering to Tufte's principles. Cairo's perceptual effectiveness is achieved through: 1) Color saturation differentiation (light gray vs dark charcoal) for pre-attentive gender recognition 2) Vertical stacking for direct proportion comparison 3) Clear percentage anchors (\u03bc_women=85.4%, \u03c3=6.3; \u03bc_men=14.6% inverse). The 0-100% Y-axis prevents misinterpretation of relative proportions while maintaining Tufte's 'lie factor' guardrails through constrained data ranges."
