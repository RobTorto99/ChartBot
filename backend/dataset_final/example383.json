The chart type is set to 'column' with 3D options enabled, including settings for rotation angles (alpha and beta), view distance, and depth. The title of the chart is 'Electricity production in countries, grouped by continent', aligned to the left. The x-axis and y-axis labels are styled with a font size of 16px and are skewed in 3D. The tooltip displays detailed information about each data point, including the series color, name, and values. The plot options include settings for series point start year and column stacking. The data series include specific countries with their respective electricity production data, grouped into stacks by continent. This configuration ensures a visually appealing and informative 3D column chart."
