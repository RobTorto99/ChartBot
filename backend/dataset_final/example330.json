The chart includes a main title and a subtitle with a source link, both aligned to the left. The x-axis is categorical, with labels styled to be slightly skewed in 3D and with a larger font size. The y-axis has a title indicating the unit of measurement (NOK million) with some margin for better readability. The tooltip displays the value with a custom suffix 'MNOK'. The chart is configured to have a 3D effect with specific angles and depth. The data series represents 'Total imports' with values for various countries, including a null value for 'Unspecified' to indicate missing data."
