The title of the chart is 'Monthly Sales Data', styled with a dark blue color and a font size of 14px. The x-axis and y-axis labels are styled with a font size of 12px. The data series represents monthly sales data for the year, with each month as a category on the x-axis and corresponding sales figures as data points. The series uses a custom color palette to differentiate the columns. The chart has a white background, a legend positioned at the bottom, and a margin of 50 pixels around the chart to ensure it is displayed clearly within its container."
