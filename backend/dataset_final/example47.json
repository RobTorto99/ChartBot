The chart includes two series: 'By week' and 'Average week', each with their respective data. The x-axis is labeled with days of the week, and the y-axis is labeled with 'Fruit units'. The legend is styled to be vertically aligned and floating with a white background. The chart also includes custom colors for the series and disables the credits. The plot options for the areaspline series include a fill opacity of 0.5 to make the area under the spline semi-transparent. The labels and titles for both axes are styled with specific font sizes and colors for better readability."
