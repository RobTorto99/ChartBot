The chart type is set to 'stock', which is suitable for displaying time series data like stock prices. The 'styledMode' is enabled, which means the chart will use Highcharts' default styling, including a dark theme. The range selector is set to the first option, allowing users to easily select different time ranges. The data for the 'AAPL' series is expected to be fetched from 'https://demo-live-data.highcharts.com/aapl-c.json' and will be displayed with two decimal places in the tooltip. The chart uses Highcharts' default colors for the series, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing appearance."
