The chart type is set to 'item', which is suitable for visualizing data in a circular or radial layout. The title of the chart is 'Parliament Visualization', styled with a font size of 16px. The data series includes names, y-values, colors, and labels for each political party, with custom colors applied to each series. The labels for the data points are enabled and formatted to display the point's label, styled with a font size of 12px. The chart includes a legend that displays the name of each series with its corresponding y-value in a semi-transparent format. Additional configurations include setting the chart's center and size, start and end angles, and point padding for better visualization. The chart is also responsive, adjusting the data labels' distance when the chart's width is 600px or less."
