The chart includes a title and subtitle, with the subtitle providing a source link for the data. The x-axis represents the countries, and the y-axis represents the production in 1000 million tons. The chart allows for y-axis zooming and includes data labels for each column. The tooltip displays the production value with a suffix of ' (1000 MT)' and has a specific background and border color. The legend is enabled to differentiate between the two series: Corn and Wheat. Each series has custom colors and border colors applied to them."
