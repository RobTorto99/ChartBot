    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset contains 528 univariate numerical measurements representing biological weights. Synthetic data was generated with \u03bc=150g, \u03c3=75g, demonstrating right skewness (\u03b3\u2081=0.87) and three modes at 75g, 115g, and 155g through intentional value clustering. The histogram was chosen for its effectiveness in distribution shape visualization, maximizing data-ink ratio by eliminating redundant gridlines and decorations. Cairo's perceptual principles are applied through consistent bin widths (20g intervals) and color saturation gradients. The \u221an binning rule (23 bins) balances resolution with statistical stability, while the orange color scale supports accurate magnitude comparisons through luminance contrast."
