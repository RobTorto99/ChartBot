    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts configuration is designed to render a Sankey chart that visualizes data flows between nodes A, B, C, and D. The chart is titled 'Data Flow Analysis' and features a white background with 50-pixel margins on all sides. The legend is positioned at the bottom of the chart for better readability. The axes and labels are styled with a dark gray color and a font size of 14px, ensuring clarity. The data series includes four flows: from A to B with a weight of 0.3 and a blue color, from A to C with a weight of 0.5 and a green color, from B to D with a weight of 0.3 and a red color, and from C to D with a weight of 0.3 and a custom gradient color from black to pink. This configuration effectively visualizes the data flows and their respective weights and colors, making it easy to interpret the relationships between the nodes."
