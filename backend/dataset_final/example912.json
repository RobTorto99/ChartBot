The chart is of type 'column', inverted, and polar, with a margin top of 40 pixels. It has a title 'Data labels enabled' and a subtitle 'The inside option is set to true'. The chart is divided into two panes, each with different start and end angles and centered differently. The x-axis and y-axis have tick intervals of 1, and labels are disabled for the x-axis. Data labels are enabled and positioned inside the columns. The chart is designed to be displayed within a container with a height and width of 600 pixels, centered on the page."
