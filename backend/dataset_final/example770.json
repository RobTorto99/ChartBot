The chart type is set to 'timeline', and the title is 'Project Timeline' with white text and a 20px font size. The axes and labels are styled with white text to contrast with the dark background. The data series includes three events, each with a specific date, label, and description. Custom colors are applied to the data labels and connectors, using a blue theme. Additional configurations include setting the chart margins to ensure proper spacing around the chart and disabling the legend for a cleaner look."
