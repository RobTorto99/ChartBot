Each series in the chart corresponds to a different level of male attractiveness, and custom colors are applied to each series to differentiate them visually. The tooltip displays detailed information about each data point, including the category and the message success percentage. The legend is disabled, and markers are turned off for the series to maintain a clean visual appearance."
