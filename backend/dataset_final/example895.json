The x-axis is labeled with months from January to December, and the y-axis represents rainfall in millimeters. The y-axis does not end on a tick, providing a cleaner look. The data series includes monthly rainfall values, styled with a custom color. Additional configurations include a background color for the chart, styled labels and titles for both axes, and a legend that is enabled and styled for better readability. The spline chart type is chosen for its smooth line representation, suitable for showing trends over time."
