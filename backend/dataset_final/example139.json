    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object is configured to render a stock chart with the specified settings. The chart type is set to 'stockChart', which is suitable for time series data like stock prices. The title of the chart is 'AAPL Stock Price', styled with a font size of 18px and a dark gray color. The axes and labels are styled using the 'grid-light' theme, with custom font sizes and colors to ensure readability. The x-axis labels are set to 12px font size with a lighter gray color, while the y-axis title is set to 14px font size with a slightly darker gray color. The y-axis labels also use a 12px font size with a lighter gray color. The range selector is included with a default selection of 1, allowing users to easily select different time ranges. The series data is expected to be fetched from 'https://demo-live-data.highcharts.com/aapl-c.json' and displayed as a single series named 'AAPL'. The tooltip for this series is configured to display values with two decimal places. The chart is set to use styled mode, which leverages CSS for styling, and the container dimensions are set to ensure the chart fits well within the specified space."
