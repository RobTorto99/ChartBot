The chart is set to use styled mode, which allows for custom styling defined in the CSS. The data series includes energy sources (Oil, Natural Gas, Coal, Renewable, Nuclear) and their distribution to various sectors (Transportation, Industrial, Residential & Commercial, Electric Power). Each node and link in the Sankey diagram is color-coded according to the custom colors defined in the CSS. The nodes are further customized with specific color indices, and the Residential & Commercial node is given a more descriptive name. The chart is configured to display a title and subtitle, enhancing the clarity and context of the visualization."
