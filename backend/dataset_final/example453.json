    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts configuration is designed to render a spline chart titled 'Monthly Average Temperature'. The chart includes two data series, 'Reggane' and 'Tallinn', each representing the average temperature for each month of the year. The chart's background is set to a light gray color, and the margins are adjusted to 50px on all sides for better spacing. The title and axis labels are styled with a dark blue color and specific font sizes for readability. The legend is positioned at the bottom of the chart for easy access to series information. Additionally, custom color gradients are applied to each series: a blue-to-green gradient for 'Reggane' and a red-to-yellow gradient for 'Tallinn', enhancing the visual distinction between the two datasets."
