    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset contains two continuous probability density functions estimating fuel consumption patterns. Each KDE curve (\u03bc_city=10.2, \u03c3_city=4.8; \u03bc_highway=8.7, \u03c3_highway=3.9) was generated from 400+ real vehicle measurements using Gaussian kernel smoothing. The bimodal distribution reveals distinct consumption regimes for different vehicle classes. The areaspline chart was chosen for its ability to show distribution overlap while maintaining Tufte's data-ink ratio through minimal gridlines and uncluttered markers. Cairo's principle of proportional ink is maintained through translucent fill colors that encode density without obscuring series overlap. The color palette (blue/orange) follows perceptual discriminability guidelines while remaining colorblind-safe. Bandwidth selection (\u03c3=1) balances noise reduction with feature preservation in the density estimates."
