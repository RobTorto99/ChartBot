    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts configuration is designed to render a pie chart that visualizes the 'Departamental Strength of the Company'. The chart includes a custom entrance animation where each slice of the pie fans out from the center, creating a visually engaging effect. The title and subtitle are aligned to the left, providing clear context for the data being presented. The pie chart itself has a border width of 2, and data labels are enabled to show both the department name and its corresponding percentage, formatted with bold text for the department name and a line break for clarity. The tooltip, activated on hover, displays the same information for each slice. The animation duration is set to 2000 milliseconds, ensuring a smooth and noticeable entrance effect. This configuration leverages Highcharts' extensive customization options to create a polished and informative data visualization."
