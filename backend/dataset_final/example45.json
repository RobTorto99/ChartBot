    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts configuration is designed to render a map chart with bubbles representing the world population in 2013 by country. The chart includes a title and subtitle for context, and the legend is styled to be vertical, aligned to the left, and includes a bubble legend with specific color ranges. The map navigation is enabled, allowing users to interact with the map. The data series consists of two parts: a 'Countries' series with a default color and a 'Population 2016' series with map bubbles. The data for the bubbles is expected to be fetched from an external source and dynamically populated into the 'data' array of the 'Population 2016' series. The chart is configured to display bubbles of varying sizes, with the smallest representing the minimum population and the largest representing the maximum population, scaled to 12% of the chart size. The tooltip for each bubble provides specific information about the country and its population in thousands."
