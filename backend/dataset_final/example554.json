The axes and labels are styled with specific colors and font sizes. A plot band is added to the x-axis to highlight a specific range (from May to July). The chart also includes a custom color for the data series and markers. Additionally, the chart is configured to have a legend and a button that removes the plot band when clicked. The background color of the chart is set to a light gray for better readability."
