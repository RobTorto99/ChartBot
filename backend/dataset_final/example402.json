The chart type is set to 'variablepie', and the title is 'zMin set to 5, smaller z values are treated as 5.'. The title font size is set to 18px, and the axis labels' font size is set to 14px. The data series includes seven data points with 'y' and 'z' values. Additional configurations include a minimum point size of 100, an inner size of 20%, and a zMin value of 5, which ensures that any z values less than 5 are treated as 5. This setup will create a visually appealing variable pie chart with the specified data and styling."
