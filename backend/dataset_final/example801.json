This chart visualizes the daily fruit consumption of a company in 2019, with three data series representing 'Plums', 'Bananas', and 'Apples'. Each series contains data points with low, median, and high values for each month. The chart includes accessibility features such as point descriptions and series descriptions for screen readers. The X-axis is labeled with the months of the year, and the Y-axis is titled 'Fruits consumed' with a minimum value of 0. The chart is responsive, adjusting the X-axis labels to shorter month abbreviations when the width is 550px or less. Tooltips are shared and sticky, and series options include sticky tracking and a whisker width of 5."
