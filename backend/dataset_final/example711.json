    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object configures a column chart that visualizes the layers of Earth's atmosphere. The chart is titled 'Earth's atmosphere' with a subtitle linking to a NASA source for additional information. The x-axis is hidden, and the y-axis is also hidden with a minimum value of 0, ensuring that the focus is on the stacked columns. The columns are stacked in percentage format, with each column having a black border and white fill. Data labels are enabled, displaying the series name and height in black text without an outline. The legend is disabled, and each data series represents a layer of Earth's atmosphere, with additional information provided in tooltips when hovering over the columns. This setup effectively communicates the relative heights and descriptions of the atmospheric layers."
