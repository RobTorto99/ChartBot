The chart allows for x-axis zooming, enhancing user interaction. The series is named 'USD to EUR' and uses a gradient color scheme for the spline, with custom colors applied. The legend is disabled, and additional styling is applied to the markers and hover states of the spline. The data for the series is expected to be populated from an external JSON file, as indicated in the original JavaScript code."
