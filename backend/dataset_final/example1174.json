    "visualization_explanation": "This dataset contains 10 categorical entries representing synthetic browser market shares. Variables include nominal (browser names) and ratio (percentage share) data types. Synthetic values were generated with a power-law distribution (\u03bc=9.2%, \u03c3=13.1) to simulate realistic market dominance patterns, summing to 100% through iterative normalization. The pie chart was selected to emphasize part-to-whole relationships despite Tufte's data-ink criticisms, justified by Cairo's principle of proportional perception in partitive comparisons. Pre-attentive processing is enhanced through strategic use of slice offsetting (Chrome segment) and categorical color differentiation. Statistical anchors include Chrome's 45% dominance (\u00b15% realistic variance) and long-tail distribution with 5 categories below 2% share."
