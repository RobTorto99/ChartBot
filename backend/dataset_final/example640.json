The data series include two sets of monthly sales data, each with a custom gradient color scheme. The first series uses a gradient from blue to green, while the second series uses a gradient from green to yellow. The chart background is set to light gray, and the legend is positioned at the bottom center of the chart. Additionally, the chart margins are set to 50 pixels on all sides to provide ample space around the chart content."
