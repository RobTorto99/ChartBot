The x-axis is labeled 'Year' and contains categories from 1995 to 2023. The y-axis is logarithmic and labeled 'Number of Internet Users (in millions)'. The data series is named 'Internet Users' and includes specific data points with values and colors. The chart also includes a custom gradient color for the series, a tooltip that displays the series name and the value in millions, and accessibility settings for point descriptions. This setup ensures that the chart is visually appealing and accessible, with a focus on highlighting the growth of internet users over time using a logarithmic scale to better visualize large value gaps."
