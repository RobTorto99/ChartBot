    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset represents a two-level hierarchical breakdown of financial statement items with 11 nodes and 10 links. Categorical variables (asset categories) are connected through quantitative flow weights (USD millions). Synthetic expansion of 'Other Non-Current Assets' maintains accounting validity through proportional distribution (\u03bc=42.52M, \u03c3=12.5M split into logical subcomponents). The Sankey diagram maximizes data-ink ratio by eliminating gridlines while maintaining clear flow paths, with color hues maintaining perceptual distinction (Cairo's principle of discriminability). Node positions follow natural accounting hierarchy from aggregated totals to specific components, with weight values preserving the fundamental accounting equation (Total Assets = Current + Non-Current)."
