The chart includes a title 'Denmark Export 2018' and a subtitle 'Source: Harvard.edu'. The data for the chart is fetched from an external JSON file, which contains the export percentages for various categories. The chart uses a custom color palette to differentiate between categories. The treemap layout is squarified, and it allows for drilling down into specific nodes. The data labels are styled with a specific font size and format, displaying the name and value of each data point. The tooltip, when hovered over a data point, displays the name and value formatted to two decimal places. The chart also includes accessibility features, such as a screen reader section and a detailed description of the chart's content."
