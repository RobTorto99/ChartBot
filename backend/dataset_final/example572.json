The chart is titled 'Custom xAxis' angle on inverted polar chart'. The x-axis is customized with an angle of 324 degrees, a tick interval of 1, and a line width of 2 with a specific color. The x-axis labels are styled with a z-index of 10, an x-offset of 5, and a y-offset of -5, all with the same color as the axis line. The y-axis is set to range from 0 to 10. The chart includes a single data series with no border and data points ranging from 1 to 9. The chart has a top margin of 25 pixels, ensuring proper spacing from the top of the container."
