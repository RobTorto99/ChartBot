    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object is configured to render an arearange chart that visualizes temperature variations by day. The chart is loaded with data from a CSV file hosted on a CDN, and the CSV data is preprocessed to handle any double newlines. The chart type is set to 'arearange', which is suitable for displaying ranges over time. The title of the chart is 'Temperature variation by day', and it is aligned to the left. The x-axis is of datetime type, making it suitable for time series data, and includes an accessibility description for screen readers. The y-axis does not have a title, keeping the focus on the data. The tooltip is configured to show crosshairs, share values across points, and append '\u00b0C' to the temperature values. The legend is disabled to simplify the presentation. The series named 'Temperatures' uses a gradient color from red to blue to represent the range of temperatures. Additional configurations include enabling zooming on the x-axis and making the plot area scrollable with a minimum width of 600px."
