The histogram series is named 'Histogram' and is configured to use the second x-axis and y-axis, ensuring it aligns correctly with the scatter plot data. The scatter plot series is named 'Data' and uses the provided dataset. The histogram includes accessibility settings to describe each point, enhancing the chart's usability for all users. The scatter plot points are styled with a marker radius of 1.5, providing a clear visual distinction between the histogram bars and the scatter plot points."
