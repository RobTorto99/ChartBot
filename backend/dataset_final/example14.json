The chart is titled 'Egg Yolk Composition' and includes a subtitle with a link to the source of the data. The pie chart segments represent different components of egg yolk, such as Water, Fat, Carbohydrates, Protein, and Ash, each with its specific percentage. The chart uses a predefined set of colors for the segments and includes data labels that display both the name and percentage of each component. The pie chart allows users to select segments and includes a legend for better readability. Additionally, the tooltip displays the percentage values with a '%' suffix when hovering over the segments."
