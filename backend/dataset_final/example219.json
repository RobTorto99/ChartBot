The chart has a white background and a light gray border, giving it a clean and modern appearance. The pie slices are colored with specific shades of blue, green, and red, which are commonly associated with data visualization. The legend is positioned at the bottom of the chart, centered, and styled with a larger font size and bold text to make it more readable. Additionally, the chart includes a button that, when clicked, removes the first data point from the series, allowing for interactive data manipulation."
