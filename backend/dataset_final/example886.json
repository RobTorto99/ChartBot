The y-axes are styled differently with specific colors and positions: the first y-axis uses the color '#5c95cc' and the second y-axis uses '#70cd5d'. The x-axis ranges from 0 to 360 with a tick interval of 30. The chart includes two data series, each associated with a different y-axis. The first series contains data points [2, 4, 7, 3, 5, 4, 7, 6, 9, 7, 3] and is linked to the first y-axis, while the second series contains data points [454, 123, 648, 443, 123, 465, 762, 487, 234, 153, 232] and is linked to the second y-axis. The plotOptions ensure that the series are plotted with a point interval of 30 and a line width of 1."
