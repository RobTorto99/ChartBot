The chart includes two series, each with specific data points and different behaviors for finding the nearest point on hover. The first series uses the x-axis to find the nearest point, while the second series uses both x and y axes. The chart's axes and labels are styled with specific colors and font sizes to enhance readability. Custom colors are applied to each series, and additional configurations such as chart margins, background color, and legend settings are included to improve the overall appearance and functionality of the chart."
