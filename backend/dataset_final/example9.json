The chart displays the percentage composition of different gases in the air, specifically Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Other gases. Each segment of the pie chart is styled with custom colors and patterns, as specified in the 'colors' array. The chart includes data labels that show the name and percentage of each gas, formatted with a percentage suffix. The tooltip also displays the percentage with a suffix and has a specific border color. The pie chart allows for point selection and shows a legend, enhancing the chart's interactivity and readability. The inner size of the pie chart is set to 75%, creating a donut-like appearance. Overall, the chart is designed to provide a clear and visually appealing representation of the air composition data."
