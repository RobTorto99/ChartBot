    "visualization_prompt": "Create a Highcharts gauge chart with rounded plot bands. The chart should have a title 'Gauge with rounded plot bands'. The gauge should display a speedometer-like interface with three plot bands representing different speed ranges. The first band should be green for speeds from 1 to 70 km/h, the second band should be yellow for speeds from 50 to 90 km/h, and the third band should be red for speeds from 70 to 119 km/h. The gauge should have a single data series named 'Speed' with a current value of 80 km/h. The chart should have a transparent background and the plot bands should have rounded corners. The y-axis should be labeled 'km/h' and the tick marks should be styled with white color and a specific length and width.",

    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts configuration is designed to render a gauge chart that simulates a speedometer. The chart is titled 'Gauge with rounded plot bands' and features a single data series named 'Speed' with a current value of 80 km/h. The gauge is divided into three plot bands, each representing a different speed range: green for 1-70 km/h, yellow for 50-90 km/h, and red for 70-119 km/h. The plot bands have rounded corners, achieved by setting the 'borderRadius' property to '50%'. The middle band, which is yellow, has a higher 'zIndex' to ensure it appears above the other two bands, avoiding any visual conflicts in the transition areas. The y-axis is labeled 'km/h' and the tick marks are styled with white color, a specific length, and width. The chart has a transparent background, enhancing the visual appeal of the gauge."
