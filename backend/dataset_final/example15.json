The chart includes a title and subtitle, with the subtitle linking to a Wikipedia source. The X-axis displays the names of the top 10 countries, while the Y-axis labels are formatted as percentages. The chart features three data series: 'Hydropower', 'Other renewable', and 'Nuclear', each with specific data points for each country. The columns are stacked in percentage mode, allowing for a clear comparison of the contribution of each energy type to the total production. The tooltip displays the percentage of each series when hovering over the columns. Additionally, each series has a custom border color to distinguish them visually."
