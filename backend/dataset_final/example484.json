The chart includes a single series with data points ranging from 1 to 25. The axes and labels are styled with specific colors and font sizes to enhance readability. The chart also includes custom colors for the series, with a primary color of '#25386f'. Additional configurations such as chart margins, background color, and legend settings are included to ensure the chart is visually appealing and well-organized. The sonification module is enabled with a duration of 4000 milliseconds and logarithmic mapping for pitch, providing an auditory representation of the data."
