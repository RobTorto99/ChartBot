    "visualization_explanation": "The dataset contains 10 categorical entries representing major industry sectors with quantitative performance metrics. Synthetic data was generated using a normal distribution (\u03bc=53, \u03c3=11) constrained to 35-75 range, ensuring domain-appropriate values while maintaining statistical plausibility. Data points were rounded to integers for clarity in business communication. The column chart was chosen for its effectiveness in comparing discrete categories, maximizing data-ink ratio through clean gridlines and direct value labels. Color palette follows Cairo's perceptual principles with sequential greens ensuring luminance differentiation for accessibility. Morphing transitions (1000ms duration) maintain visual continuity during type changes, supporting cognitive retention through Tufte's principle of causal scaffolding. Statistical anchors include synthetic data variance (\u03c3\u00b2=121) mimicking real-world performance fluctuations across industries."
