    "visualization_explanation": "The provided Highcharts chartOptions object configures an inverted spline chart that visualizes the 'Atmosphere Temperature by Altitude' according to the Standard Atmosphere Model. The chart is inverted, meaning the X-axis represents the vertical altitude and the Y-axis represents the horizontal temperature. The X-axis is titled 'Altitude' and its labels are formatted to display the altitude in kilometers. The Y-axis is titled 'Temperature' and its labels are formatted to display the temperature in degrees Celsius. The chart includes a single series named 'Temperature' with data points representing the temperature at various altitudes. The chart does not display a legend, and the tooltip shows the altitude and temperature for each data point when hovered over. The chart is designed to be intuitive for data sets where the X-axis represents vertical altitude, as described in the accompanying HTML and CSS."
