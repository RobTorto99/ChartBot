The x-axis is configured as a category axis with labels styled in a lighter gray color and a font size of 14px. The y-axis includes a title styled similarly and labels with the same styling. The data series includes specific tree types and their respective counts, with each bar colored uniquely using a predefined list of colors. The legend is disabled to keep the chart clean and focused on the data representation."
