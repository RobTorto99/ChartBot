The X and Y axes are styled with dark gray labels and a specific font size. The data series includes one series named 'Reading' with the provided data points, each represented as a 3D coordinate. The chart uses a radial gradient for the data points, giving them a 3D feel. Additional configurations include setting specific margins, disabling the legend, and enabling 3D frame options with transparent colors to enhance the 3D effect."
