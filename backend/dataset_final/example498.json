The chart includes three data series, each with specific data points and custom colors. The axes and labels are styled with a consistent color scheme and font sizes to ensure readability. The legend is also styled to match the overall theme. Additionally, the chart includes responsive settings to adjust the layout for smaller screens, hiding the y-axis and reducing the chart's spacing on screens with a maximum width of 450 pixels."
